# Heroku Buildpack: NGINX

Nginx-buildpack vendors NGINX inside a dyno and connects NGINX to an app server via UNIX domain sockets.

## Motivation

Some application servers (e.g. Ruby's Unicorn) halt progress when dealing with network I/O. Heroku's Cedar routing stack [buffers only the headers](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing#request-buffering) of inbound requests. (The Cedar router will buffer the headers and body of a response up to 1MB) Thus, the Heroku router engages the dyno during the entire body transfer â€“from the client to dyno. For applications servers with blocking I/O, the latency per request will be degraded by the content transfer. By using NGINX in front of the application server, we can eliminate a great deal of transfer time from the application server. In addition to making request body transfers more efficient, all other I/O should be improved since the application server need only communicate with a UNIX socket on localhost. Basically, for webservers that are not designed for efficient, non-blocking I/O, we will benefit from having NGINX to handle all I/O operations.

## Versions

### Cedar-14 (deprecated)
* NGINX Version: 1.9.5
### Heroku 16
* NGINX Version: 1.9.5
### Heroku 18
* NGINX Version: 1.18.0
### Heroku 20
* NGINX Version: 1.18.0

## Requirements (Proxy Mode)

* Your webserver listens to the socket at `/tmp/nginx.socket`.
* You touch `/tmp/app-initialized` when you are ready for traffic.
* You can start your web server with a shell command.

## Requirements (Solo Mode)

* Add a custom nginx config to your app source code at `config/nginx.conf.erb`. You can start by copying the [sample config for nginx solo mode](config/nginx-solo-sample.conf.erb).

## Features

* Unified NXNG/App Server logs.
* [L2met](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/l2met) friendly NGINX log format.
* [Heroku request ids](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-request-id) embedded in NGINX logs.
* Crashes dyno if NGINX or App server crashes. Safety first.
* Language/App Server agnostic.
* Customizable NGINX config.
* Application coordinated dyno starts.

### Logging

NGINX will output the following style of logs:

```
measure.nginx.service=0.007 request_id=e2c79e86b3260b9c703756ec93f8a66d
```

You can correlate this id with your Heroku router logs:

```
at=info method=GET path=/ host=salty-earth-7125.herokuapp.com request_id=e2c79e86b3260b9c703756ec93f8a66d fwd="67.180.77.184" dyno=web.1 connect=1ms service=8ms status=200 bytes=21
```
#### Setting custom log paths

You can configure custom log paths using the environment variables `NGINX_ACCESS_LOG_PATH` and `NGINX_ERROR_LOG_PATH`.

For example, if you wanted to stop nginx from logging your access logs you could set `NGINX_ACCESS_LOG_PATH` to `/dev/null`:
```bash
$ heroku config:set NGINX_ACCESS_LOG_PATH="/dev/null"
```

### Language/App Server Agnostic

nginx-buildpack provides a command named `bin/start-nginx` this command takes another command as an argument. You must pass your app server's startup command to `start-nginx`.

For example, to get NGINX and Unicorn up and running:

```bash
$ cat Procfile
web: bin/start-nginx bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb
```

#### nginx debug mode
```bash
$ cat Procfile
web: bin/start-nginx-debug bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb
```

### nginx Solo Mode

nginx-buildpack provides a command named `bin/start-nginx-solo`. This is for you if you don't want to run an additional app server on the Dyno.
This mode requires you to put a `config/nginx.conf.erb` in your app code. You can start by coping the [sample config for nginx solo mode](config/nginx-solo-sample.conf.erb).
For example, to get NGINX and Unicorn up and running:

```bash
$ cat Procfile
web: bin/start-nginx-solo
```

### Setting the Worker Processes and Connections

You can configure NGINX's `worker_processes` directive via the
`NGINX_WORKERS` environment variable.

For example, to set your `NGINX_WORKERS` to 8 on a PX dyno:

```bash
$ heroku config:set NGINX_WORKERS=8
```

Similarly, the `NGINX_WORKER_CONNECTIONS` environment variable can configure the `worker_connections` directive:

```bash
$ heroku config:set NGINX_WORKER_CONNECTIONS=2048
```

### Customizable NGINX Config

You can provide your own NGINX config by creating a file named `nginx.conf.erb` in the config directory of your app. Start by copying the buildpack's [default config file](config/nginx.conf.erb).

### Force SSL

You can add a redirect/force SSL based on Heroku headers. Full, commented example in the [default config file](config/nginx.conf.erb) or in the [nextjs with forceSSL config file](config/nginx-nextjs-with-forcessl.conf.erb).

```
if ($http_x_forwarded_proto != "https") {
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

### Customizable NGINX Compile Options

This requires a clone of this repository and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). All you need to do is have Docker setup and running on your machine. The [`Makefile`](Makefile) will take care of the rest.

Configuring is as easy as changing the options passed to `./configure` in [scripts/build_nginx](scripts/build_nginx).

Run the builds in a container via:

```
$ make build
```

The binaries will be packed into `tar` files and placed in the repository's root directory. Commit the changes and push your repository.

Finally update your app to use your custom buildpack on Heroku either at https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/#{YOUR_APP_NAME}/settings or via the Heroku CLI via:

```
heroku buildpacks:set #{YOUR_GIT_REPO_CLONE}
```

To test the builds locally:

```
$ make shell
$ cp bin/nginx-$STACK bin/nginx
$ FORCE=1 bin/start-nginx
```

### Application/Dyno coordination

The buildpack will not start NGINX until a file has been written to `/tmp/app-initialized`. Since NGINX binds to the dyno's $PORT and since the $PORT determines if the app can receive traffic, you can delay NGINX accepting traffic until your application is ready to handle it. The examples below show how/when you should write the file when working with Unicorn.

## Setup

Here are 2 setup examples. One example for a new app, another for an existing app. In both cases, we are working with ruby & unicorn. Keep in mind that this buildpack is not ruby specific.

### Existing App

Update Buildpacks to use the latest stable version of this buildpack:
```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku-community/nginx
```
Alternatively, you can use the Github URL of this repo if you want to edge version.

Update Procfile:
```
web: bin/start-nginx bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb
```
```bash
$ git add Procfile
$ git commit -m 'Update procfile for NGINX buildpack'
```
Update Unicorn Config
```ruby
require 'fileutils'
listen '/tmp/nginx.socket'
before_fork do |server,worker|
	FileUtils.touch('/tmp/app-initialized')
end
```
```bash
$ git add config/unicorn.rb
$ git commit -m 'Update unicorn config to listen on NGINX socket.'
```
Deploy Changes
```bash
$ git push heroku master
```

### New App

```bash
$ mkdir myapp; cd myapp
$ git init
```

**Gemfile**
```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'unicorn'
```

**config.ru**
```ruby
run Proc.new {[200,{'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ["hello world"]]}
```

**config/unicorn.rb**
```ruby
require 'fileutils'
preload_app true
timeout 5
worker_processes 4
listen '/tmp/nginx.socket', backlog: 1024

before_fork do |server,worker|
	FileUtils.touch('/tmp/app-initialized')
end
```
Install Gems
```bash
$ bundle install
```
Create Procfile
```
web: bin/start-nginx bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb
```
Create & Push Heroku App:
```bash
$ heroku create
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby
$ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nginx
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "init"
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku logs -t
```
Visit App
```
$ heroku open
```
